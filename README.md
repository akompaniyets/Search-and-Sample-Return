_Project Description:_

   This project began by providing an introduction to Jupyter notebooks, specifically as an effective means of documenting and testing Python code.  Afterwards, a brief introduction was provided to using Anaconda in creating unique local environments tailored to specific tasks; as such, the project itself was completed using an Anaconda environment. Additionally, GitHub was first introduced with this project, illustrating how it will be used throughtout the entirety of the course to provide helpful files. Alongside this, the concept of using the Git terminal to clone repositories was covered.
     
   Continuing, the project itself is based on a previously-held Mars Rover Challenge, using a Unity-based environment to model a small rover in a custom-made environment. The rover is outfitted with a front-facing camera and a robotic arm, the former of which is intended to be used for environment mapping, with the latter intended for the pick-up of randomly placed small gold rocks.
     
   The goal of the project was to develop sufficient perception capability for the rover to map the majority of its environment. An optional challenge was provided to locate and pick up the aforementioned gold rocks, which was also undertaken and accomplished.
